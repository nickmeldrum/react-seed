# react-seed

A seed project for a React build

## Design decisions

 * Build and dev environment using Webpack and webpack-dev-server (hot reloading)
 * Language: using ES2015 compiled using babel (integrated into Webpack)

## Installation

 * npm install && npm start
 * browse to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see "hello world"

## Details, details

 * hot loading (as of 1.3.1) isn't working with stateless components, think it's fixed in v3 of react-hot-loader but v3 beta is HARD to get installed right with no docs
